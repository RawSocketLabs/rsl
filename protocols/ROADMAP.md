# protocols — roadmap

Status and the plan of record. Each protocol lands as its own crate on `bnb`; the crate status
table in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) tracks per-crate stage.

## Built

- [x] **Workspace scaffold** — conventions (dual-use doctrine, standards-in-config, per-crate
      SemVer), CI (fmt/clippy/test/deny/MSRV), release automation (tags only, no publish yet),
      onboarding docs, and the per-crate template.
- [x] **`link/ethertype`** — the harness proof: `EtherType` as a `bnb` `#[derive(BitEnum)]` with a
      `catch_all` for unknown values. First dogfood of bnb on a protocol type.
- [x] **`application/dns` — Increment 1 (the pure codec)** — decode (following compression
      pointers inline via `seek`) + uncompressed encode. Header (flat `#[bitfield]` State),
      `Name` as a `#[bin(codec)]` newtype, `RType`/`RClass`/`QType`/`QClass` BitEnums with
      catch-alls, `RData` as a `tag`-dispatched union with a raw-bytes `Custom` fallback (fixing
      the reference crate's 36 misparsing stubbed types), `Message`. Golden wire vectors
      (uncompressed round-trip byte-identical; compressed decoded with names resolved inline) +
      an adversarial suite. Dogfooded, on real DNS: codec newtypes, bulk `read_bytes`, ctx-`tag`
      dispatch + aux ctx + bytes catch-all, `count = expr`, nested-bitfield flattening, absolute
      `seek`. **Increment 2** (encode compression, needs the bnb mutable-state gap) and a
      client (needs `rawsock`) remain.

## Protocol adoption order

Pull each protocol in as a `bnb` rewrite. Order favors dogfooding value and low coupling:

1. [~] **`application/dns`** — the pure codec (Increments 1 + 2: decode, uncompressed +
       compressed encode) **and a synchronous UDP resolver client** (the `client` feature,
       `dns::Resolver`) built on bnb's `net` `MessageDatagram` — **not** `rawsock` (a normal
       resolver needs no raw sockets; a dual-use spoofing client is the `rawsock` case).
       The resolver now also does **DNS-over-TCP fallback** (UDP → TCP on a truncated response). **Remaining**: EDNS(0), caching.
2. [~] **`transport/tcp`** done (header codec: `Control` `#[bitfield]` flags word, raw options
       sized by `data_offset` + a `TcpOption` structured view, dual-use stored checksum/offset).
       **`transport/udp`** done (header codec **plus** the `inject` feature: a `rawsock::Protocol`
       `Udp<P>` layer + pseudo-header `udp_checksum` — the socket layer's first on-the-wire
       consumer, the `rawsock` extraction trigger, now live). **TCP has the same `inject` layer**
       (`Tcp<P>` + `tcp_checksum`). Remaining transport follow-up: privileged L3 send (needs
       rawsock's `network` backend — in progress).
3. [x] **`network/ip`** + **`network/icmp`** done. `ip`: IPv4 header codec + the `inject` `Ip<P>`
       layer that supplies the L4 pseudo-header and computes the header checksum. `icmp`: RFC 792
       header codec + an `Icmp<P>` inject layer whose checksum is **self-contained** (no
       pseudo-header). A full `Ip(Udp/Tcp/Icmp(..))` stack emits a correct datagram — every
       checksum verifies (a composed ping is a real, valid packet).
4. [ ] **`link/ethertype` consumers: `link/arp`, `link/ethernet`** — the one real
       protocol-to-protocol chain.
5. [ ] Application protocols as demand dictates: `tftp`, `socks`, `smb`, `nbt`, `ssh`, …

## bnb co-evolution — gaps the DNS port is expected to surface

Consuming bnb from git exists precisely to feed these back upstream. Each becomes a
`bitsandbytes` ROADMAP item; fix in bnb rather than working around it here.

- [x] **Mutable, message-scoped, sibling-threaded scratch state** — **fixed upstream**
      (`bitsandbytes` #82): `Sink::scratch` — a type-erased scratch slot the `BitWriter` carries
      (`with_scratch`), reachable from any codec via `w.scratch()` + `downcast_mut`, shared across
      all a message's fields because the sink is the one `&mut` threaded through them. DNS
      `to_compressed_bytes` seeds a `CompressionDict` into it. The headline gap, closed — and it's
      **encode-only** for now (decode needs no dict: pointers are followed inline via `seek`); a
      `Source` scratch is a trivial future addition if a decode use appears.
- [x] **Overridable stored-length field** — **fixed upstream** (`bitsandbytes` #83):
      `WireLen<T>`, either `auto()` (derive at encode) or `set(n)` (explicit override). Decode
      yields `Set`, so `to_bytes()` is correct-by-default *and* round-trips byte-identically while
      a forged length survives. `#[bw(auto = count(x)|bytes(x))]` (same-struct) +
      `#[bin(auto_len(field.nested = count(source), …))]` (cross-struct). DNS now uses it for the
      four header counts (cross-struct, element) and `rdlength` (same-struct, byte length),
      deleting the manual `as u16` sync in `Message::assemble`.
- [ ] **A `ctx`-dispatched type has no plain `BitEncode`** — surfaced by the `rdlength` migration:
      `RData` is `#[bin(ctx(...))]` so bnb emits only `encode_with`, but `#[bw(auto = bytes(x))]`
      probes a target's size via plain `bit_encode`. DNS works around it with a one-line local
      `impl BitEncode for RData` (delegating to `encode_with` through a throwaway ctx, since
      RData's *encode* ignores the ctx). bnb could emit a plain `BitEncode` for a ctx type whose
      encode is context-free (or `bytes(x)` could probe via `encode_with`). Minor; low priority.
- [x] **`#[bin(ctx(...))]` generates undocumented `…Ctx` fields** — **fixed upstream**
      (`bitsandbytes` #81): each generated field now carries a `/// The `<name>` context
      parameter.` doc. The DNS crate runs `#![deny(missing_docs)]` again. The first bnb finding
      fed back from real-protocol dogfooding.
- [ ] **`#[bitfield]` sub-byte backing (minor)** — bnb bitfields need a byte-width backing
      (u8/u16/…), so the reference crate's u5 `OpCode` / u7 `Flags` sub-byte groupings had to be
      flattened into the parent `State`. Flattening is arguably cleaner (matches the RFC diagram),
      so this is a low-priority ergonomic nicety, not a blocker — noted for completeness.
- [x] **Confirmed covered (verified during Increment 1, not gaps):** ctx-`tag` dispatch composed
      with an auxiliary ctx param used in variant `count`s + a catch-all binding the unmatched
      tag and reading the remaining bytes; `count = <expr>` arithmetic; `BitEnum` catch-all
      binding the raw value; absolute-offset `seek` for message-relative pointers; `#[bin(codec)]`
      newtypes and bulk `read_bytes` as the `Name` codec's building blocks.

## Open decisions

- [x] **`rawsock` extraction** — **done**: published at `github.com/RawSocketLabs/rawsock` as a
      single crate, consumed here as a git dep behind `udp`'s `inject` feature
      (`default-features = false` → the `compose` trait + `Loopback`, no `rustix`). UDP was the
      trigger — the first protocol to compose real, checksummed packets.
- [ ] **`refcheck` extraction + wiring** — trigger: DNS compliance tracking. The `//~` grammar is
      already kept in-source; decide the corpus-hosting and CI-integration shape then.
- [ ] **bnb dependency: git → crates.io** — flip when bnb cuts a 1.0 (or a stable 0.x) release
      and the DNS-driven churn settles. Pin to a rev in the interim.
- [ ] **`testutil`** — introduce the shared test/bench/logging helper crate when the second
      protocol crate needs it (the seed crate's tests are self-contained).
